# Penn Center for Neuroaesthetics Ambient Light Sensor

Written in CircuitPython for ease of maintenance from across the country.

Currently tested on an Unexpected Maker Feather S3 & Adafruit BH1750 soldered so that `VIN 3Vo GND SCL SDA` on the BH1750 connect to `1 38 33 SCL SDA` on the Feather. Note that `ADDR` is left unsoldered and `3Vo`/`38` is unused but soldered anyway to avoid having to chop header pins in half.

## Setup

Obtain a CircuitPython-compatible microcontroller and copy everything in this folder into it, overwriting where applicable. Then, add a `secrets.py` file that looks like this:
```python
secrets = {
    "ssid": "replace me with your WiFi network name",
    "wifi_pw": "replace me with your WiFi password",
    "email": "address@site.com"
    "password": "S3cureP@ssw0rd"
    "login_encrypted": "AGFkZHJlc3NAc2l0ZS5jb20AUzNjdXJlUEBzc3cwcmQ=" # See below the code snippet for an explanation!
    "host": "smtp.gmail.com",
    "port": 465, # Gmail's required SSL port
}
```
How did we get the value for `login_encrypted`?
In a terminal (not Python), type `echo -ne '\0{your username}\0{your password}' | base64`.
With the above email and password, it would be `echo -ne '\0address@site.com\0S3cureP@ssw0rd' | base64` (exactly, to the letter!), which should output `AGFkZHJlc3NAc2l0ZS5jb20AUzNjdXJlUEBzc3cwcmQ=`. Do this for your username and password, then copy it into the `login_encrypted` field.

And everything should work! The blue light should flash on or off every five minutes, alternating with each measurement.

To update to the newest version of our code, run `./update.sh`.
